1/. If you pull this repository but do not see the file correctly, read the .gitignore file to see if the files you are looking are ignored. If the files are ignored, you can install them regarding on the team you are working on.

Ex: Im working on frontend team. There are node_modules, dist files. They are in .gitignore file and will be ignored. When I clone the repo to my laptop, I will have to install the the "node_modules" and rebuild the project for the smoothly running.

2/. When you clone github repo to your local, you should create your own branch before making any changes, this will avoid conflicting when pushing files, codes to the repo. Github Desktop may ask you to fork the repository -> just fork it with parent-related option. When done, you should create your own branch and making changes only in that branch. Then you can commit the changes to the "origin" of your branch. Finally, you create pull request to merge the changes to "main" branch.
Please ask your leader for further information.
